    When alex adds an external event junk-event-1
    Then The response should be true with errorCode null

    Then wait until user alex has reached status waiting for external event
    And alex should get sync state notification wait events [blank], blocked events [developers], requested events [developers], external events [blank], current event [blank], b-threads info list {name:bt-1,requested:[developers]}{name:bt-2,blocked:[developers]}{name:bt-3}{name:bt-4}{name:bt-5}, and events history [junk-event-1]

    When alex toggles mute sync states to false
    Then The response should be true with errorCode null

    When alex adds an external event world
    Then The response should be true with errorCode null

    Then wait until user alex has reached status syncstate

    When alex toggles wait for external event to false
    Then The response should be true with errorCode null

    And alex should get sync state notification wait events [blank], blocked events [developers], requested events [developers], external events [israel,from], current event [blank], b-threads info list {name:bt-1,requested:[developers]}{name:bt-2,blocked:[developers]}{name:bt-3}, and events history [world,hello,junk-event-2,junk-event-1]

    When alex clicks on next sync
