Feature: Sync States

  Scenario: four users request to debug with multiple sync states stops
    Given user alex has connected with userId 4655ae8e-cdfe-4ce3-ac2b-dc03743a780f
    And user tal has connected with userId d1b10451-bbb0-43e2-b5ad-d10afa73449e
    And user avishai has connected with userId 23c125e3-2ab1-4111-ad4a-0a5de594ae26
    And user ron has connected with userId fddc28aa-e203-40c0-989d-276e0eabf04c

    Given alex has connected to websocket with alex-session
    And ron has connected to websocket with ron-session

    When alex asks to debug with filename testFile1 and toggleMuteBreakpoints true and toggleMuteSyncPoints false and toggleWaitForExternalEvent false and breakpoints 10,21
    Then The debug response should be true with errorCode null and breakpoints 10,21 for user alex
    When ron asks to debug with filename testFile2 and toggleMuteBreakpoints true and toggleMuteSyncPoints false and toggleWaitForExternalEvent false and breakpoints 4,9,11
    Then The debug response should be true with errorCode null and breakpoints 4,9,11 for user ron

    Then wait until user alex has reached status syncstate
    And wait until user ron has reached status syncstate

    Then alex should get sync state notification wait events [blank], blocked events [blank], requested events son-e, external events [blank], current event [blank], b-threads info list {name:bt-world-son,requested:[son-e]}, and events history [blank]
